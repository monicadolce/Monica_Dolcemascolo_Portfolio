      Hello! I'm Monica and I'm so glad you decided to take a look at my page. I get my inspiration from nature's color palette. The world around me is rich in beauty and has so much to offer when creating a web page. When I'm not behind the screen, I'm either out and about with my dogs, hiking, traveling, snowboarding, scuba diving, or experimenting in the kitchen!
